          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet. But the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate. If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets. But if the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow. Interrupting the control flow in this way allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way. Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on...</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
          <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. </li>
          <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses.</li>
